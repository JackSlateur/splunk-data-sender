# Splunk Data Sender

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/878ba78c2afd4dd9a37877c0136e49f6)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/andrea.salvatori92/splunk-data-sender?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Sonic0/splunk-data-sender&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

**Splunk Data Sender is a very simple and minimal Python package for sending logged events to an installation of Splunk Enterprise throw REST API**

*This logger requires the destination Splunk Enterprise server to have enabled and configured the [Splunk HTTP Event Collector](http://dev.splunk.com/view/event-collector/SP-CAAAE6M).*

## Installation

Manual:

    python3 setup.py install

## Usage

    from splunk_data_sender import SplunkSender

Then create a SplunkSender instance with your preferred configuration. Now you can use the two methods **send_data()**
and **check_acks()** to, respectively, send logs and check messages acks(Requires useAck enabled in HEC).

Example:

```python
import logging
from splunk_data_sender import SplunkSender
    
splunk_conf = SplunkSender(
    host='splunk.example.com',
    port='8088',
    token='851A5E58-4EF1-7291-F947-F614A76ACB21',
    index='main',
    channel='16c70678-e516-44a9-854d-d139929e6869', # GUID
    api_version='0.1',
    #hostname='hostname', # manually set a hostname parameter, defaults to socket.gethostname()
    #source='source', # manually set a source, defaults to the log record.pathname
    #sourcetype='generic_single_line', # manually set a sourcetype, defaults to 'generic_single_line'
    #allow_overrides='True' # Whether to look for one of the plunk built-in parameters(index, host, ecc)
    #verify=True, # turn SSL verification on or off, defaults to True
    #timeout=60, # timeout for waiting on a 200 OK from Splunk server, defaults to 60s
    #retry_count=5, # Number of retry attempts on a failed/erroring connection, defaults to 5
    #retry_backoff=2.0,  # Backoff factor, default options will retry for 1 min, defaults to 2.0
    #enable_debug=False, # turn on debug mode; prints module activity to stdout, defaults to False
)

splunk = SplunkSender(**splunk_conf)

# The first payload is a quote to the italian theme song of Hello!Spank
txt_record = "Hello! Splunk resta con me, Hello! Splunk non te ne andare, Caro Splunk! gioca con me, siamo amici io e te."
json_record = { # this record will be parsed as normal text due to default "sourcetype" conf param
        "source": "spacecraft Discovery 1",
        "host": "HAL9000",
        "sourcetype": "_json",
        "index": "main",
        "event": {"message": "I am afraid I can't do that Dave.", "severity": "ERROR"},
        "rack": "42",
        "os": "Linux, obvious",
        "arch": "x64"
    }
payloads = [txt_record, json_record]

splunk_res = splunk.send_data(payloads)
logging.info(splunk_res)

ack_id = splunk_res.get('ackId')
splunk_ack_res = splunk.send_acks(ack_id)
logging.info(splunk_ack_res)
```
## Configuration parameters notes
### "sourcetype"
If this param is sets to "_json" (and "allow_overrides" too), not built-in params will be added inside a **"fields"** key described below.
Refer to the [official Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.5/Data/Listofpretrainedsourcetypes) 
for more information about source types. 

### "allow_overrides"
If this param is set to "True", whether to look for one of the Splunk built-in parameters 
(time, source, host, index) it will override the autocompleted parameters.<br>
For example, a json record with "time"=1486683865.000 will simulates a payload in the past for Splunk.

## Notes for JSON source type event 
Refer to the [official Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.5/Data/IFXandHEC) 
for more information about the use of JSON source type.

### Nested JSON inside the "event" property
In some cases, events have nested json which contains the custom fields to be indexed. In this case you have to set "sourcetype" = "_json".

### "fields"
Fields for indexing that do not occur in the event payload itself.<br>
You can use this parameter when you do not want particular fields to be included in the event data, 
but you need additional metadata for indexing and searching.<br>
In the above example, "rack", "os" and "arch" will included inside "fields" key.<br>

Using this method is also typically faster than the nested JSON method.<br>
Be aware that you must send HEC requests containing the fields property to the _/collector/event_ endpoint. Otherwise, they will not be indexed.

## Retry Logic

This library uses the built-in retry logic from urllib3 (a retry counter and a backoff factor). 
Should the defaults not be desireable, you can find more information about how to best configure these
settings in the [urllib3 documentation](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/b2289cd2d5d21bd31cf4a818a4e0ff6951b2317a/requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py#L104).
